My name is Bryan Engelsen a Graduate Student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I will be receiving my M.S. in May of 2018. I am excited about applying my knowledge of atmospheric science to the many industries that are impacted by the weather. From hurricanes that impact coastal regions to transportation delays caused by adverse weather conditions, weather plays a significant role in the operations of many industries.
